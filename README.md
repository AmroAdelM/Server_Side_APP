# Server_Side_APP
- ServerConnection.cpp is using the winsock2 library for windows socket applications.
- The app is assuming the server is configured based on an xml file called server_config.xml which should be written in the same format as provided in the example.
- The xml configuration file is allowing modularity in adding more clients in the list of known clients and also adding different type of inofrmation items or even removing some.
- The app is using the xml parser library pugixml(pugixml.hpp, pugixml.cpp, pugiconfig.hpp) which is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface
- The server is supposed to be up all time.
- The server is connecting to the local host socket, with the protocol TCP. It is better to use the SCTP protocol for more reliablity and the multihoming ability but I used TCP as an example.
- The server is waiting to any connection, and if any message recieved it sent back an acknowledgment saying "recieved".
- The server is currently showing only if the message had any error or not.
- The server is catching all types of errors but only showing if there is an error in the console without defining the type of error.
- As mentioned above, Server is not sending emails for misconfiguration but instead saving that internaly.
- The server is logging clients messages in a file with the format Client_"ID".xml, creating the file if it is the first time, and adding the message to a new line if one or more messages was sent before.
- In order to minimize repetition, all Clients should have one information items type, which is stored in the configuration file. if adding a new client you should assign one of old types or define a new type with your needs.
